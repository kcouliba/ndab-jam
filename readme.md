# Ndab

A project realized through a (quarantine game jam)[https://itch.io/jam/ndab-jam]

## THEME: "Pack" or "انضب" (i.e. انضب بالبيت)

Join other jamers on the discord channel here where you can form teams and ask for help.

Hello, and welcome to Quarantine Jam, a new online Game Jam, hosted by Lebanese Game Developers and taking place on our LGD discord! An online event on an online venue!

What is a Game Jam? A game jam is a fun, creative and collaborative event, where groups of people, sometimes friends or sometimes strangers, work and help each other to create a game. Everyone is given a theme and 48 hours to make one game. After you're done, you submit it here.

Whether you're an artist, programmer, designer, musician, writer, veteran game maker or newcomer. Everyone is welcome to join!
Game Jams are usually done on a large site, but this will be an online jam, so it will be on a WEBsite. (We 'd show ourselves out for that pun, but we're under lock-down)

We're all staying home, so why not use this time to have fun and make some fun games for ourselves and others!

We're even going to stream some of the best games once the Jam is done!

Join us in this special online Game Jam! Remember to stay safe, wash your keyboards and انضب بالبيت (p.s: Make sure your keyboard is waterproof)
